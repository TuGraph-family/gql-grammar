## Project Name

ISO GQL (ISO/IEC 39075) Antlr4 Grammar File

## Description

This repository contains the [Antlr4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4) Grammar file implementation for [the Graph Query Language standard (ISO/IEC 39075)](https://www.gqlstandards.org/), which is currently in the draft stage. Our latest grammar files are based on the draft of version 2023.03. GQL is a database language for modeling structured data as a graph, and for storing, querying, and modifying that data in a graph database or other graph store. By open-sourcing these grammar files, we aim to facilitate the quick adoption of GQL in graph databases and expedite the standardization process.

## Getting Started

To get started with using the G4 file in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/TuGraph-family/gql-grammar`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd gql-grammar`
3. Use the G4 file in your Antlr4-based project for GQL query parsing and processing.
